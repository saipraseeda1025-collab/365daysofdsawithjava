day 1:
i tried with java day1.java but it shown  Error: Could not find or load main class day1
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: day1
i used then,java -cp . day1,then it worked,because the folder i created was in onedrive,so it doesn't auto-create .java

day2:
i coded sum and avg finding method for array

day3:
found min and max in an array by assigning min and max to arr[0]

day4:
used for loop with complexity of 0(n),and proceeded to find the reverse of the array
